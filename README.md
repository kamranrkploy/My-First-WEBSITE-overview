# My-First-WEBSITE-overview
this is just an overview of a static website , frontend created using pure html and css only.
there are plenty of languages and framework that can make this webpage really easily.
but if you are a beginner and have learned css then you should try and built something that is pure css based.
this project will be as a motivation for those who want to mak pure css based static webpage.
remember this is just a front end.
